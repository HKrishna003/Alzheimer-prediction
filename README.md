# Alzheimer-prediction
It is a simple webpage while uses a flask application which allows us to upload a brain image and the that image is passed to a deeplearning model, which process the image and able to predict the ouput class of the image. The different classes used to develop the CNN model of Alzheimer's prediction are:
1. MildDemented
2. ModerateDemented
3. NonDemented
4. VeryMildDemented
## To run the project navigate to the Alz-chat directory through command prompt and simply run using "python app.py".
